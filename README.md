# Languages of Thailand
Thailand is home to several under resourced languages. I wanted to do a comparison on tools available to three languages. I compared Thai, Akha, and Hmong.  Hmong is very closely related to my native language which does not have any documented datasets available. 

The challenges presented in this project are related to data collection, data wrangling, and using few resources to reach a conclusion.

I performed several types of comparisons including: ESPNet, Google Cloud ASR, ****and speech diarization. 

- ESPNet included a Jupyter notebook where I inputted in the audio and had the program assume the language
- Google Cloud ASR could only be used for Thai but it performed well
- Speech diarization is the partitioning of audio segments to identify the user.
